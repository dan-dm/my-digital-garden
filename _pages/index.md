# HeyðŸ‘‹, 
## I'm Dan.

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  This <span style="font-weight: bold">"digital garden ðŸŒ±"</span> is a place where I share my notes, thoughts and learning process.

## This "digital garden" is a place where I share my notes, thoughts and learning process. 
Fun fact: this process of how to organize notes and learn effectively is also called the _Zettelkasten method_ and you can read more about this system from this __amazing__ book [How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking â€“ for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes) by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.

This digital garden template is free, open-source, and [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
