# Wait, what's a digital garden?

A __digital garden__, also known as the ***Zettelkasten ( ZK ) method*** is a system of effective learning through better note-taking. 

### _It's the perfect balance of chaos and order._

You learn more efficiently when you touch _chaos_, maybe some new [[javascript]] method¬†‚Äï or some other scary thing that jumps at you __from-the-unknown__, but then you back-pedal to your _comfort zone_ where __what you KNOW__ lives and you try to figure out where _exactly_ does the new thing fit, and how it is connected to your existing knowledge, thus structuring knowledge as you would a blog post or an essay. Taking fleeting notes is easy, writing a book is hard. The optimal zone for learning is in the middle.üéØ

With a Zettelkasten system this mental process is copied, hopefully sped up and results in an inter-linked lattice of notes, much like how our brain collects facts and memories (think mind maps!). By also periodically reviewing notes (when linking new knowledge) you get the benefit of _spaced repetition_ which is scientifically proven to be the best method of remembering facts!

I first learned about this system from this __amazing book:__ [How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking ‚Äì for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes) by S√∂nke Ahrens, I highly recommend it. Here are some excellent articles that actually do [Niklas Luhmann and his Zettelkasten](https://medium.com/@rebeccawilliams9941/the-zettelkasten-method-examples-to-help-you-get-started-8f8a44fa9ae6#:~:text=Niklas%20Luhmann%20and%20his%20Zettelkasten) method some justice, and explain the use of my favorite [Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) application](https://dev.to/bretzawilski/using-zettelkasten-and-obsidian-to-learn-more-effectively-277e)¬†‚Äï [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).‚úåÔ∏è
