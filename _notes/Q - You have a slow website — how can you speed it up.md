# You have a slow website — how can you speed it up?

Before you begin optimizing your site, the first thing you need to do is diagnose the site's issues. This likely requires you to get into the browser developer console and check network requests (time they take, payload sizes, headers used) and also look at performance charts of your code.

Apps are slow either because they take too much time to get the files/data they need to run, or the code itself has bad performance. To optimize your site, the solutions typically fall under three categories:

1.  Reduce the amount of bytes sent from a server
2.  Download the right resources at the right time
3.  Reduce expensive / long operations

Ways to speed up your application include:

1.  **Compress your static files and minify code:** Reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent to the browser.
2.  **Cache static files correctly in the browser:** This will speed up subsequent trips to the site. You must use the appropriate headers (etags and cache control) so the browser knows how long to store files.
3.  **Use a CDN to cache static files:** This has a few benefits: 1) It allows you to put files closer to your users 2) It allows you to spread out network requests (most modern browsers only allow six concurrent requests to a single domain) 3) Users may have a required file already cached from a CDN 4) Reduces load on your server
4.  **Optimize images:** Make sure images are an appropriate size for how they are used on the page. Images are still just static assets, so we must make sure they cache correctly, use compression, and are served from a CDN.
5.  **Load only the content necessary for a page and prioritize above the fold:** You can chunk your JavaScript so it only loads what a page needs. For content on the page, you can lazy load it and show it only when necessary. For example, only download images when they come into view.
6.  **Minimize redirects:** Sending a user through multiple URLs will ultimately slow down the time it takes for them to get to the page.
7.  **Progressive rendering:** Instead of waiting for the entire data of the page to load, treat it as separate parts, and display each piece as their data is received. This can require the server to expose better API endpoints or the client to call them correctly.
8.  **Reduce API payload size:** The less data that is sent through the wire, the faster the page can load.
9.  **Use SSR or SSG:** Using server rendering or static page generation allows you to send content that a user can view without needing the entire JS bundle to download first.
10.  **Minimize time to first bite:** Fix any network issues and use `dns-prefetch`.
11.  **Minimize slow operations:** This can be either on the server or the client. For slow server calculations or database queries, you can cache the result in an in-memory storage like Redis.
12.  **Handle browser events effectively:** Poor event handling can grind an app to a halt. For example, if you have an `onscroll` listener, use a [throttle](https://skilled.dev/course/throttle) to minimize the number of callbacks that are executed.
