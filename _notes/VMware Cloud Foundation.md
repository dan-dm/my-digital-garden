# VMware Cloud Foundation

VMware Cloud Foundation is the unified SDDC platform that bundles [[VMware vSphere|vSphere]] ([[VMware ESXi|ESXi]] and vCenter Server), vSAN, and NSX into a natively integrated stack to deliver enterprise-ready cloud infrastructure. 

VMware Cloud Foundation discovers the hardware, installs the VMware stack (ESXi, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX), manages updates, and performs lifecycle management. 

VMware Cloud Foundation can be self-deployed on compatible hardware or preloaded by partners and can be used in both private and public clouds (VMware Cloud on AWS or VMware cloud providers).
