JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don’t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. JavaScript automatically types a variable based on what kind of information you assign to it (e.g., that '' or " " to indicate string values). Many other languages, like [[Java]], require you to declare a variable’s type, such as int, float, boolean, or String.
