Title: Shorthand operator
---

When working with conditions, the shorthand method can save you a lot of time and space.

For example, if you write a condition to check empty, null and undefined conditions for a variable, you must write 2 conditions within the if statement.

`if (x !== “” && x !== null && x !== undefined) { ... }`

However, if you are using the shorthand operator, you just need to write a single condition like below:

`if ( !!x ) { ... }`
