## Classes and prototypes (OOP) in [[javascript]]

- OOP is an enormously popular paradigm forstructuring our complex code (instead of hard-to-maintain procedural code like => do *this*, then *this*, then *this* .. *ad infinitum*)
- In JS this is built behind-the-scenes upon the Prototype chain - the feature that enables emulation of OOP but is also a compelling tool in itself
- Difference between *\_\_proto\_\_* and *prototype*
- The *new* and *class* keywords as tools to automate our [[objects]] & method creation
