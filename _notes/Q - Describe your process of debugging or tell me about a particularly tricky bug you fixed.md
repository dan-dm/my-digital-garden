# Describe your process of debugging or tell me about a particularly tricky bug you fixed

Debugging is an inevitable part of coding, and there are claims that we spend anywhere from 20-90% of our time debugging. Because of this, companies want to be confident that you can do it effectively, especially if there is a bug that is in production affecting real users.

Debugging can appear in interviews in a few ways:

1.  Discuss your process of debugging
2.  Tell me about a time you debugged a difficult issue
3.  Be given a program and asked to debug and/or refactor it

Often this isn't one of those questions that has a "right" answer, but it's typically more of an open discussion, intended to understand your thought process and experience.

Possible points to mention:

1.  Using `console.log`. There isn't anything wrong with using this, although some people like to frown upon it. If it is your preferred method, just be prepared to justify why.
2.  Breakpoints and stepping through them in the browser
3.  Investigating files in the browser
4.  Looking at network requests and assessing the request and response content
5.  Debugging Node code with breakpoints through your text editor
6.  Using source maps for transpiled code
7.  Testing and how you use it to reduce bugs
8.  Using static type checking like TypeScript
9.  Using a tool like Sentry.io to capture bugs
10.  Investigating server logs
11.  Deployment and rollback process for production apps
12.  Determining how to reproduce a bug from production
