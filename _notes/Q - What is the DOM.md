# What is the DOM

DOM stands for Document Object Model. A web page is just a text document written in HTML, and the DOM is the data representation of this HTML document using objects to describe its structure and content. The DOM treats the HTML document as a tree data structure where each node is an object that represents a part of the document.

The DOM can be represented using any programming language (since at its core, it's just a data structure), but we most commonly think of it in JavaScript since that is the programming language of web browsers. The DOM allows programmatic access to its tree by exposing methods that allow us to update the structure, style, and content.

-   The DOM is the standard with which we represent a web page as a data structure
-   The DOM is a tree data structure
-   The nodes in the tree are JavaScript objects
-   The objects expose methods and data about a particular section of the web page and allow us to interact with and update it.
