# What is the difference between mutable and immutable, and what are the benefits of using immutable data

Immutable data has been growing in popularity with JavaScript developers. It means that once a variable or object is declared, it can't be altered or updated. This gives us increased stability and confidence in the state of our application.

If an object is mutable, this means that it can be modified after it is created.

**Advantages of Immutability**

-   Simplified programs without fear of objects evolving or changing through a program's lifetime. If we pass an object around to different functions or different threads, we know it won't change at any point.
-   Change detection. In JavaScript, objects are stored in variables as pointers. If we create a new object, it takes on a new memory address and thus a new pointer which allows us to know data has changed. On the other hand, if it were mutable and we alter an existing object, we will have the same pointer and would have to inspect every property to determine if there was an update.
-   Better memory management. We can cache an object in memory and use this single copy as much as needed because all functions know they're accessing a read-only copy of the same data.
-   Optimize CPU, memory, and rendering. If we only need to maintain a single copy of any object, we can share it everywhere to prevent any recalculations based on the data, which will only be triggered if a new object is created.

**Downside of Immutability**

-   It's easy to mess up immutability in JS. If you're relying on immutability but someone implements it incorrectly, it can cause challenging bugs. One common example of this is using a spread operator `...` which only makes a shallow copy, and nested objects can still be altered.
-   If you use immutable objects that are frequently destroyed and recreated for updates, it can decrease performance when compared to just mutating an object's property.

A key takeaway is that immutability can either help or hurt performance. If you want to enforce it strictly, it's usually best to use a library that is optimized and also enforces immutability effectively.
