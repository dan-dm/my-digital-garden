# Explain any framework(s) you have used and the value that they provide

A question like this is meant to generate a discussion more than to elicit a specific answer. They want to hear what frameworks you have used and the opinions you have about them (pros and cons). They also want to see if you understand modern web development and how applications are built in the real-world.

A very important note: don't mention a framework unless you are prepared to discuss it and compare it to other frameworks. An interviewer isn't looking to see if you have tried every single technology. They are trying to see if you understand modern web development and justify the design decisions that you have made. You can briefly mention something like "I tried Angular for a simple project, but really focused on React afterward because I like how React...". But if you only know React (or any other single framework), really hone in on what benefits you think it provides.

For example, let's consider React.

**Pros**

-   Component architecture
-   Flexibility
-   Focused on being as close to JavaScript as possible (minimal special syntax)
-   Make complex applications feel simpler and easy to manage
-   Single responsibility principle. It only focuses on the view / presentation layer, and the developer chooses how to handle other aspects of the app (ie. data).
-   Strong community
-   Applications are fast (although other frameworks have gained ground and even surpassed React's performance)
-   Engaged core development team
-   Commitment to constantly evolving the library but with a focus on backward compatibility
-   Cross-platform with React Native

**Cons**

-   Challenging handling of `this`
-   SSR can be difficult
-   Unopinionated. Because of React's flexibility, it can also hurt productivity because teams are required to pick their own patterns and libraries, whereas other opinionated frameworks enforce you build an app a certain way
-   Reliant on the community for solutions since they aren't all baked into the core library
-   Backed by a big tech company (some developers don't want to feel bolted to the whims of an entity like Facebook)
-   It was one of the first component libraries, so it has some old patterns that newer libraries have improved
